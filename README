Stack Computers: the new wave

Chapter 1 Introduction and Review

Last In First Out (LIFO)
stack-based vs register-based
Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISCs) vs Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISCs)

Expression evaluation stack, e.g. X = (A + B) * (C + D)
The return address stack, e.g. recursion
The local variable stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy
The parameter stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy

High performance without pipelining
Very simple processor logic
Very low system complexity
Small program size
Fast program execution
Low interrupt response overhead
Consistent program execution speeds across all time scales
Low cost of context swithing

Forth forms a stack machine that has two stacks:
  expression evaluation/parameter passing
  return addresses
