Stack Computers: the new wave
Philip Koopman
1989

Chapter 1 Introduction and Review

Last In First Out (LIFO)
stack-based vs register-based
Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISCs) vs Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISCs)

Expression evaluation stack, e.g. X = (A + B) * (C + D)
The return address stack, e.g. recursion
The local variable stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy
The parameter stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy

High performance without pipelining
Very simple processor logic
Very low system complexity
Small program size
Fast program execution
Low interrupt response overhead
Consistent program execution speeds across all time scales
Low cost of context swithing

Forth forms a stack machine that has two stacks:
  expression evaluation/parameter passing
  return addresses

Chapter 2 A Taxonomy of Hardware Stack Support

Attributes
  The number of stacks: single or multiple
  The size of stack buffer memories: small or large
  The number of operands in the instruction format: 0, 1, or 2+
