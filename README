Chapter 1 Introduction and Review

Last In First Out (LIFO)
stack-based vs register-based
Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISCs) vs Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISCs)

Expression evaluation stack, e.g. X = (A + B) * (C + D)
The return address stack, e.g. recursion
The local variable stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy
The parameter stack, e.g. recursion and reentrancy

High performance without pipelining
Very simple processor logic
Very low system complexity
Small program size
Fast program execution
Low interrupt response overhead
Consistent program execution speeds across all time scales
Low cost of context swithing

Forth forms a stack machine that has two stacks:
  expression evaluation/parameter passing
  return addresses

Canonical Stack Machine:

Minimum components of an ML0 design:
  the data bus
  the data stack (DS)
  the return stack (RS)
  the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) with its top of stack register (TOS)
  the program counter (PC)
  program memory with a memory address register (MAR)
  control logic with an instruction register (IR)
  an input/output section (I/O)

Minimum set of operators:

Instr-     Data Stack
uction   input   -> output     Function

 !       N1 ADDR ->            Store N1 at location ADDR in
                               program memory

 +       N1 N2   -> N3         Add N1 and N2, giving sum N3

 -       N1 N2   -> N3         Subtract N2 from N1, giving
                               difference N3

 >R      N1      ->            Push N1 onto the return stack

 @       ADDR    -> N1         Fetch the value at location
                               ADDR in program memory,
                               returning N1

 AND     N1 N2   -> N3         Perform a bitwise AND on N1 and
                               N2, giving result N3

 DROP    N1      ->            Drop N1 from the stack

 DUP     N1      -> N1 N1      Duplicate N1, returning a
                               second copy of it on the stack

 OR      N1 N2   -> N3         Perform a bitwise OR on N1 and
                               N2, giving result N3

 OVER    N1 N2   -> N1 N2 N1   Push a copy of the second
                               element on the stack, N1, onto
                               the top of the stack

 R>              -> N1         Pop the top element of the
                               return stack, and push it onto
                               the data stack as N1

 SWAP    N1 N2   -> N2 N1      Swap the order of the top two
                               stack elements

 XOR     N1  N2  -> N3         Perform a bitwise eXclusive OR
                               on N1 and N2, giving result N3

 [IF]    N1      ->            If N1 is false (value is 0)
                               perform a branch to the address
                               in the next program cell,
                               otherwise continue

 [CALL]          ->            Perform a subroutine call to
                               the address in the next program
                               cell

 [EXIT]          ->            Perform a subroutine return

 [LIT]           -> N1         Treat the value in the next
                               program cell as an integer
                               constant, and push it onto the
                               stack as N1

Infix notation, e.g. (12 + 45) * 98
Postfix notation or Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), e.g. 98 12 45 + *
